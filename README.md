# MobWeb_ProductAppointment extension for Magento

A simple Magento extension that adds a form the product page. The customer can fill out this form and select a date and time for a meeting. The form data will then be sent to an email address specified in the configuration. This way, the customer can book an appointment to see the product in person.

## Installation

Install using [colinmollenhour/modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman/).

##Â Configuration

Go to *System -> Configuration -> (Catalog) -> Product Appointment* to enter the email address that should receive the form data.

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible.
